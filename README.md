# DATA-STRUCTURES
To make students familiar with writing algorithms to implement  different data structures like stacks, queues, trees and graphs, and various sorting techniques.

Algorithm Analysis:
Introduction to Algorithm, Algorithm Analysis, Asymptotic Notations.
Introduction to arrays and Abstract Data Type (ADT)
Lists: List using arrays and linked list- Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Circular 
LinkedList.

Stacks: Stack ADT, Implementation using arrays and linked list.
Applications of stacks: Infix to postfix expression conversion, Evaluation of Postfix expressions 
and balancing the symbols.
Queues:
Queue: Queue ADT, Implementation of Queue using arrays and linked list, circular queue, 
DEQUE

Sorting: Bubble sort, Insertion Sort, Selection sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort & Heap Sort

Trees: Introduction, Tree traversals, Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, Balanced Binary search 
tree - AVL Trees and its operations.

Graphs: Fundamentals, Representation of graphs, Graph Traversals: BFS, DFS.
Hashing: Hash Table, Hash Function, Collision resolution Techniques- separate Chaining,
Open addressing, rehashing.
